> When you just don't have the words. Snoop does.

## Web Service

Returns an audio file. If someone clicks the link, better hope their speakers
are turned down. Especially if you send them the dirty version.

It's perfect for team meetings, ping it to your co-workers while on a call and
listen for the fun :thumbsup:.

If you don't add anything to the path it just picks some random phrases from
generally unliked things. If you pass it some words though you can custom
tailor the message for your audience. Just send this in your group chat:
